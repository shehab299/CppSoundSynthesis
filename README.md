SynthWAV is a C++ project focused on implementing sound synthesis techniques from scratch, including amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and ring modulation (RM). Additionally, SynthWAV provides functionality to export synthesized audio examples as WAV files. Dive into the world of audio programming with SynthWAV, where you can explore, experiment, and generate high-quality WAV files directly from your synthesized sounds.
